## TECH STACK

# Figma:
Figma as a core component of our tech stack was used to create the intuitive user interface, prototype and generally streamlined our design process.

# GraftBase:
Leveraging GraftBase, I crafted a robust GraphQL backend that elegantly manages our application's data. GraftBase enabled me to define a structured data schema, handle queries, and execute mutations effortlessly. This powerful backend foundation ensures optimal data retrieval and manipulation.

# Apollo GraphQL:
I integrated Apollo GraphQL on the frontend to effortlessly consume the GraphQL API provided by GraftBase. This library streamlined the process of fetching and manipulating data, while its caching and state management features optimized user experience. Apollo's capabilities played a pivotal role in maintaining a smooth flow of information between the backend and frontend.

# Next.js:
Next.js, a dynamic React framework, formed the core of our frontend development. By leveraging Next.js, I created server-rendered and statically generated pages that ensured rapid loading times and enhanced search engine visibility. The framework's automatic code splitting improved the app's performance and maintained a fluid user interface.

# Redux:
To manage application state, I employed Redux, a state management library. This choice facilitated the centralization of data, ensuring a predictable data flow and simplified interactions. With Redux, I effectively handled complex data flows while upholding maintainable and structured code practices.

# Tailwind CSS:
I adopted Tailwind CSS for consistent and efficient styling. This utility-first framework expedited the styling process with pre-built classes that seamlessly integrated into our HTML components. Tailwind's modular approach allowed for effortless customization, empowering me to maintain a cohesive design across the application.


# Cloudinary:
For seamless image management, Cloudinary became our solution of choice. Its cloud-based platform streamlined image upload, storage, and delivery. By optimizing images for various devices and screen sizes, Cloudinary played a pivotal role in enhancing both performance and user experience.
